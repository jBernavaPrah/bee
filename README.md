##ReactBeePlugin
This is a simple project to show how to integrate BeeFreePlugin into React APP.  
In the project directory, you can run:  

### `yarn install`
then
### `yarn start`
The app will start in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`
Will run the tests.<br />
Currently only one test was written, but if there are a strong specifications or for bigger works, I prefer to work using TDD Pattern.

### `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
